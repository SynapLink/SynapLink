# SynapLink is a private sofware engineering group.
Main Website: [1leet.com](https://1leet.com)
We do various types of projects, but the primary part of it as well as managing this GitHub profile is a work of a single person who you can contact in Telegram: [damniewa](https://t.me/damniewa)

## Basic information

Based on Telegram we moved to GitHub to post some projects. Main communication is done through Telegram DMs or a COEPIT Chat which you can join on request.
Our people are not as experienced to join professional teams, we just do things on our own trying our best. The main list of languages we work with are:
* `C#` for Windows applications
* `JavaScript` for userscripts of websites
* `Python` for quick accessible tools
* `Java` and `Kotlin` for Android applications

## Our main projects so far

* Changing game server
* Changing values in game and then pushing them to server
* Antilose - which basically means you cant lose

For more information about this application contact us in either Telegram(`@damniewa`) or mail us an email `m@1leet.com`

### KaHook!

A fork of userscript KaHack! which is basically automated answers parser for a Kahoot! quiz, the catch is you need to have a quizId for answers to be displayed, and the only way to get it is by looking at the url on your teachers or the hosts of the quiz screen to get it. I must say its easier to get online as you just gotta screenshot teachers screenshare and rewrite the ID calmly.
